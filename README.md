4.you will see the blank screen and on your left side , you have several options like Templates , character, property , text, bg( background) , image , video , music , effect and update 

5.There will be two options in your hands under the creation of character. One is create your own character and another is my character.

6.If you want to create your own character click and build up your character or if you are not Willing to do then under the my Character options choose your Character whom you like .

7.Choose one character first and place it on the blank page . If you like to have another character then you can choose it .

8.But note that you should add actions , expressions , music , background,  voice or tone of your character and set in on your Timeline .
